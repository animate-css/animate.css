> Animate.css v4 brought some **breaking changes**, please refer to the [migration guide](#migration) before updating from v3.x and under.

**Animate.css** is a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations for you to use in your projects. Great for emphasis, home pages, sliders, and general just-add-water-awesomeness.
