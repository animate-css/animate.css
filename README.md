## _Just-add-water CSS animation_

## Installation

Install with npm:

```shell
npm install animate.css --save
```

Install with yarn:

```shell
yarn add animate.css
```

## Getting started

You can find the Animate.css documentation on the [website](https://animate.style/).

## Accessibility

Animate.css supports the [`prefers-reduced-motion` media query](https://webkit.org/blog/7551/responsive-design-for-motion/) so that users with motion sensitivity can opt out of animations. On supported platforms (currently all the majors browsers and OS), users can select "reduce motion" on their operating system preferences and it will turn off CSS transitions for them without any further work required.

Pull requests are the way to go here. We only have two rules for submitting a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a [pen](https://codepen.io). That **last one is important**.
