# Contributing to Animate.css
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Animate.css! Before contributing, please make sure you understand the guidelines provided here. Animate.css is widely used, so it’s important to maintain a high level of quality and to contribute with the interests of the community in mind.

## Design Guidelines
Animations, like many facets of visual and interaction design, can be highly subjective. Maintaining a consistent library of animations in an active community can be difficult; these design guidelines are designed to help encourage thoughtful criticism of new animations that are proposed for Animate.css.

The animations in Animate.css should follow a few key principles:

- **Animations should be subtle.** Avoid creating animations that involve large translations, or span a natural duration of longer than 1 second.
- **Animations should be tolerable.** Related to subtlety, animations should be tolerable—seeing them repeatedly should not become too annoying or overbearing.
- **Animations should not interfere with document flow or control/input availability.** In other words, the absence of an animation should never reduce usability of a product: they should be non-critical and seen as “progressive enhancements”. Avoid animations that change properties such as `position` or `display`.
- **Animations should be helpful.** They should be designed to guide users to a point of interest, ease natural reading order, or to communicate relationships between elements.
- **Animations should feel familial.** Avoid introducing animations that feel out-of-place compared to the existing set.
- **Animations should feel natural.** Animations should reflect, as much as is reasonable, motion that occurs in natural physics. Avoid extreme timing functions, and model animations on real-world events.
